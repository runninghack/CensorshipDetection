How to use this code :

In test package, there is one package called TestGraphModelIHT.

1. TestGraphModelIHT package:
	I gave a concrete example to show how to use the algorithm. Just run this code and test if it is right.
	You may need to add your own code in line-78 of TestGraphModelIHT.java. 

In main packages, there are graphModelIHT package and scoreFuncs package

1. graphModelIHT package :
	We implement the graph model iht algorithm in this package. There are two lines your may need to change.
	I have labeled as TODO tag. (line-277 and line-308).
2. scoreFuncs package :
	I have added YourOwnStat.java class in this package, you need to implement those two methods labeled as TODO. If you have extra input parameters in your code just need to change the line-277 and line-308 in GraphModelIHT.java.
	
If you have any questions, just let me know. Thank you.
